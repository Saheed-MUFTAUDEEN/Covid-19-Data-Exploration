# Analyzing COVID-19 Data Using SQL

## Project Descripton 

This SQL project analyzes COVID-19 data to gain insights into the pandemic's impact. The project focuses on data from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) starting from 1st January 2020 to 10th Febraury 2023 which provides daily updates on COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccinations across the world. The goal of the project is to extract insights from the data and visualize the trends and patterns.

## Data Source

The data used in this project comes from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) available for download on [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The data is provided in a comma-separated values (CSV) format and includes information such as the date, country, and number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccinations.

## SQL Queries 

To extract insights from the data, the project uses several SQL queries. These queries focus on analyzing the data by location, date, poplation, and other relevant factors. Some of the key queries used in the project include:

- Query to calculate the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- Query to calculate the global death percentage.
- Query to calculate the total number of death recorded by continents.

## Results and Insights 
After analyzing the data, the project gained several insights into the pandemic's impact. Some of the key findings include:

- The total covid-19 confirmed cases was 670,711,800 cases.
- The total death recorded was 6,814,078.
- the global percentage death was 1.02 percent. 
- 10,860,775,485 people have been vaccinated globally.
- United state, India, France, Germany and Brazil were top 4 countries with heighest number of confirmed cases. 
- United state, Brazil, India, and Russia, were top 4 countries with heighest deaths. 
- United state, Brazil, India, and Russia, were top 4 countries with heighest deaths. 
- Europe had the highest total cases per continent, followed by Asia, North merica, and South America.
- Europe had the total number of deaths recorded as per continent, followed by Asia, North America, and South America.

## How to Use the Project 
To use this project, you will need to have a SQL server installed and the COVID-19 data downloaded. You can run the SQL queries in a SQL editor such as MySQL Workbench or Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The queries are provided in the Covid19-Data Exploration SQL file provided in this repository.

## Conclusion 
This SQL project provides valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze large datasets. While the project focuses on the Our World in Data, the same techniques could be applied to other COVID-19 datasets or other types of data.
